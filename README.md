# price_list_GUI
A GUI that allows the user to upload excel files and csv files and browse through those files.
Purpose of the program is so that the user can compile all of their documents (e.g. price list) in a single file and search a specific item quickly.

#### note: displaying a huge data is really slow because each field is generated by a tkinter label. a suggestion to improve the running time of creating the table is appreciated
